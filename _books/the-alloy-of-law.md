# The Alloy of Law

*The Alloy of Law* is the first book in Brandon Sanderson's Wax and Wayne series, set 300 years after the events of the original Mistborn trilogy. The book introduces readers to a world that has evolved from a medieval fantasy setting to a more industrialized society, combining elements of the Wild West with the established magic system of Allomancy.

## Key Concepts

- **Railroads** - Connecting cities and enabling trade
- **Electricity** - Beginning to replace traditional lighting
- **Industrialization** - Factories and mass production
- **Social change** - New class structures and political systems

### 2. Twinborn Powers

The book introduces Twinborn - individuals who possess both Allomantic and Feruchemical abilities:
- **Waxillium Ladrian** - A Coinshot (steel) and Skimmer (iron)
- **Wayne** - A Slider (bendalloy) and Bloodmaker (gold)

### 3. The Lawman's Dilemma

Wax, a former lawman from the Roughs, must navigate the complex politics of the city while maintaining his sense of justice. The book explores the tension between law and morality.

## Worldbuilding Evolution

- **Adapting to city life** - Learning to navigate complex social situations
- **Balancing duty and desire** - Choosing between his responsibilities and personal happiness

- **Growth potential** - Learning to take his abilities and responsibilities seriously

## Themes and Philosophy
