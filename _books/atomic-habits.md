# Atomic Habits

*Atomic Habits* is a book by James Clear that explores how small, incremental changes can lead to remarkable results over time. The book provides a practical framework for building good habits and breaking bad ones.

## Key Concepts

### 1. The Power of Tiny Changes

Clear argues that improvements of just 1% each day can yield exponential results over time. The effects of our habits multiply as we repeat them.

### 2. The Four Laws of Behavior Change

The book presents a framework for creating good habits and breaking bad ones:

- **Make it obvious** (cue)
- **Make it attractive** (craving)
- **Make it easy** (response)
- **Make it satisfying** (reward)

### 3. Identity-Based Habits

One of the most powerful insights in the book is that lasting change comes from focusing on who you wish to become, not just what you want to achieve. When habits become part of your identity, they're much more likely to stick.

### 4. Habit Stacking

Clear introduces the concept of "habit stacking," which involves pairing a new habit with an existing one to make it easier to implement.

## Connections to Other Ideas

The concept of small, incremental improvements in Atomic Habits connects well with the [[zettelkasten-method]], which emphasizes building knowledge gradually through small, interconnected notes.

The focus on systems rather than goals aligns with the philosophy of [[digital-garden-philosophy]], where the emphasis is on the process of growing ideas rather than producing finished products.
