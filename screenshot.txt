This is a placeholder for the screenshot.png file mentioned in the README.

In a real implementation, you would replace this with an actual screenshot of your Jekyll Garden site.

The screenshot should:
- Show the homepage with some example notes
- Demonstrate the design and layout of the site
- Include the graph visualization if possible
- Be in PNG or JPG format
- Have a resolution of approximately 1200x800 pixels
