Welcome to my digital garden! This is a place where I cultivate ideas, thoughts, and knowledge. Unlike traditional blogs, a digital garden is a non-linear collection of interconnected notes that grow and evolve over time.

Feel free to explore my notes, follow the connections between ideas, and watch as this garden grows.
