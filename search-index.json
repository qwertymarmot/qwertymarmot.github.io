      "content": "# Digital Garden Philosophy The digital garden philosophy represents a shift in how we think about creating and sharing content online. It's a move away from the chronological, stream-based approach of traditional blogs toward something more organic and interconnected. ## Core Principles ### 1. Tending vs. Publishing Digital gardens are meant to be tended to over time, not just published once and forgotten. Like a real garden, they require regular care, pruning, and attention. Notes evolve as your understanding deepens. ### 2. Learning in Public Digital gardens embrace the concept of \"learning in public\" — sharing your thoughts and ideas even when they're not fully formed. This approach values the process of learning as much as the end result. ### 3. Non-linear Organization Unlike blogs, which are organized chronologically, digital gardens are organized by context and connection. Ideas link to other ideas, creating a web of knowledge that can be explored in multiple ways. ### 4. Epistemic Humility Digital gardens acknowledge that knowledge is always evolving and incomplete. They embrace uncertainty and revision, rather than presenting ideas as definitive or final. ## Historical Context The term \"digital garden\" has roots in the early web, but gained popularity in the late 2010s as a response to the limitations of social media and traditional blogging. It draws inspiration from: - **Hypertext**: The original vision of the web as an interconnected knowledge space - **Wikis**: Collaborative, interlinked knowledge bases - **Zettelkasten**: A note-taking method focused on connections between ideas - **Personal knowledge management**: Tools and systems for organizing personal knowledge ## Digital Gardens vs. Traditional Blogs | Digital Gardens | Traditional Blogs | | --------------------- | --------------------- | | Non-linear | Chronological | | Continuously evolving | Static once published | | Connection-based | Time-based | | Focus on ideas | Focus on articles | | Exploratory | Presentational | ## Related Notes - [[welcome-to-my-digital-garden]] - [[zettelkasten-method]] - [[networked-thought]] - [How to Take Smart Notes]({% link _books/how-to-take-smart-notes.md %}) ## References 1.

      "title": "Habit Formation",
      "content": "# Habit Formation Habit formation is the process by which behaviors become automatic. When we repeat actions in consistent contexts, they become habitual—requiring less conscious thought and effort to perform. ## The Science of Habit Formation Habits form through a neurological loop consisting of three parts: 1. **Cue**: The trigger that initiates the behavior 2. **Routine**: The behavior itself 3. **Reward**: The benefit you gain from the behavior This loop, when repeated over time, creates neural pathways that strengthen with each repetition, making the behavior increasingly automatic. ## Timeframe for Habit Formation Contrary to the popular myth that it takes 21 days to form a habit, research by Phillippa Lally at University College London found that it takes anywhere from 18 to 254 days for a person to form a new habit, with an average of 66 days for a new behavior to become automatic. ## Strategies for Effective Habit Formation ### 1. Start Small Begin with tiny habits that require minimal motivation. As James Clear discusses in [Atomic Habits]({% link _books/atomic-habits.md %}), these small changes can lead to remarkable results over time through the power of compounding. ### 2. Use Implementation Intentions Frame your intentions in the format: \"When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.\" This strategy has been shown to significantly increase follow-through. ### 3. Stack Habits Attach new habits to existing ones. For example, \"After I brush my teeth, I will meditate for one minute.\" ### 4. Design Your Environment Make good habits obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying while making bad habits invisible, unattractive, difficult, and unsatisfying. ### 5. Track Your Progress Use habit trackers to maintain awareness of your behavior patterns and to provide visual feedback on your consistency. ## Breaking Bad Habits Breaking existing habits requires: 1. Identifying the cues that trigger the habit 2. Disrupting the routine by substituting a new behavior 3. Finding alternative ways to experience the reward ## Connection to Other Concepts The process of habit formation relates closely to the [[zettelkasten-method]] in that both involve creating systems that reduce friction and cognitive load. Just as good habits automate beneficial behaviors, the Zettelkasten method automates aspects of knowledge management. ## References 1. Clear, J.

      "title": "How to Use Wikilinks",
      "content": "# How to Use Wikilinks Wikilinks are a powerful feature of digital gardens that allow you to create connections between notes. They're a simple way to link to other notes in your garden, making it easy to navigate and discover related ideas. ## What Are Wikilinks? Wikilinks (also called bidirectional links) are a special type of link that uses double square brackets to reference another note. For example, `note-title` creates a link to a note with the title \"note-title\". What makes wikilinks special is that they create a two-way connection: 1. The link in your current note points to the target note 2. The target note automatically shows a \"backlink\" pointing back to your current note This bidirectional nature helps build a network of interconnected ideas. ## How to Create Wikilinks Creating wikilinks in your digital garden is simple: 1. Identify a concept or idea that should link to another note 2. Surround the concept with double square brackets: `like this` 3. The text inside the brackets will be used to find or create the target note ### Examples ```markdown This is a link to [[welcome-to-my-digital-garden]]. I'm learning about the [[zettelkasten-method]] for note-taking. Check out this book: [[Book: How to Take Smart Notes]]. ``` ## Best Practices for Wikilinks To get the most out of wikilinks in your digital garden: ### 1. Link Liberally Don't be shy about creating links. The more connections you make, the richer your garden becomes. If you mention a concept that has its own note (or should have its own note), link to it. ### 2. Use Consistent Naming Try to be consistent in how you name your notes and how you reference them. This makes it easier to create and maintain links. ### 3. Create Links Before Notes You can create wikilinks to notes that don't exist yet. This is a great way to identify gaps in your garden that you might want to fill later. ### 4. Review Backlinks Regularly review the backlinks section of your notes to discover unexpected connections and to see how ideas relate to each other. ### 5. Link to Books To link to a book note, use the format `[[Book: How to Take Smart Notes]]`. This helps distinguish book notes from regular notes. ## Wikilinks vs. Traditional Links | Wikilinks | Traditional HTML Links | |-----------|------------------------| | `note-title` | `[Link text](url)` | | Bidirectional | One-way only | | Internal to your garden | Can link anywhere | | Focus on connections | Focus on navigation | | Automatically show backlinks | No backlink tracking | ## Related Notes - [[welcome-to-my-digital-garden]] - [[digital-garden-philosophy]] - [[networked-thought]]",

      "title": "Networked Thought",
      "content": "# Networked Thought Networked thought is an approach to thinking and knowledge management that emphasizes connections between ideas rather than hierarchical categorization. It's based on the understanding that our brains naturally work through association, linking concepts together in a complex web rather than organizing them into rigid structures. ## The Network Model of Knowledge Traditional knowledge organization often relies on hierarchical systems like: - File folders - Categories and subcategories - Outlines and tables of contents Networked thought, by contrast, organizes knowledge as a graph or network: - Ideas are nodes in the network - Connections between ideas are edges or links - The value comes from the relationships between ideas - New insights emerge from unexpected connections This approach mirrors how our brains actually work—through association rather than categorization. ## Benefits of Networked Thought ### 1. Encourages Creative Connections By focusing on links between ideas, networked thought helps you discover unexpected connections and generate new insights. ### 2. Adapts to Complexity Networks can handle complexity better than hierarchies. They allow ideas to exist in multiple contexts simultaneously without duplication. ### 3. Evolves Organically A network of ideas can grow and evolve naturally as you add new information, without requiring major reorganization. ### 4. Mirrors Brain Function Our brains naturally think through association. Networked thought works with this tendency rather than against it. ### 5. Reduces Artificial Categorization It frees you from having to decide exactly where a piece of information \"belongs\" in a rigid structure. ## Tools for Networked Thought Several modern tools support networked thought: - **Digital gardens** like this one - **Zettelkasten systems** that emphasize connections between notes - **Graph-based note-taking apps** like Roam Research and Obsidian - **Concept mapping software** like TheBrain - **Wikis** with robust linking capabilities ## Implementing Networked Thought To start thinking in networks: 1. **Focus on connections**: When you encounter a new idea, ask \"What does this connect to?\" rather than \"Where does this belong?\" 2. **Create links liberally**: Don't be afraid to create many connections between your ideas. 3. **Review your network**: Periodically explore the connections you've made to discover patterns and insights. 4. **Embrace emergence**: Let structure emerge naturally from connections rather than imposing it from the top down. 5. **Think associatively**: Train yourself to think in terms of \"this reminds me of that\" rather than \"this belongs in that category.\" ## Challenges of Networked Thought While powerful, networked thought does have some challenges: - It can be disorienting without some navigational aids - It may be harder to get a \"big picture\" view without explicit structure - It requires regular maintenance and review to be effective - It can be difficult to share with others who are used to hierarchical organization ## Related Notes - [[digital-garden-philosophy]] - [[zettelkasten-method]] - [[how-to-use-wikilinks]] - [How to Take Smart Notes]({% link _books/how-to-take-smart-notes.md %}) ## References 1.

Unlike traditional blogs, a digital garden is a non-linear collection of interconnected notes that grow and evolve over time. ## What is a Digital Garden? A digital garden is a different approach to content creation and knowledge management. Instead of publishing polished, finished articles, a digital garden embraces the idea of \"learning in public\" and shows the evolution of thoughts and ideas. Some key characteristics of digital gardens: - **Non-linear**: Notes are connected through links rather than chronology - **Evolving**: Content is constantly updated and refined - **Interconnected**: Ideas link to each other, forming a network of knowledge - **Personal**: It reflects the gardener's interests and thinking process ## How to Navigate This Garden You can explore this garden in several ways: 1. Browse the notes on the homepage 2. Use the search function to find specific topics 3. Click on tags to see related notes 4. Follow wikilinks to discover connected ideas 5. Explore the graph visualization to see the network of notes ## Types of Notes In this garden, notes are categorized by their stage of development: - **Evergreen notes**: Well-developed, mature ideas - **Seedling notes**: Early thoughts that need development - **Budding notes**: Ideas that are starting to take shape ## Related Notes - [[digital-garden-philosophy]] - [[how-to-use-wikilinks]] - [How to Take Smart Notes]({% link _books/how-to-take-smart-notes.md %}) Happy exploring!",

      "title": "Zettelkasten Method",
      "content": "# Zettelkasten Method The Zettelkasten method is a note-taking and knowledge management system developed by German sociologist Niklas Luhmann. The word \"Zettelkasten\" means \"slip box\" in German, referring to the physical box of index cards that Luhmann used to organize his notes. ## Core Principles ### 1. Atomic Notes Each note in a Zettelkasten contains a single idea, concept, or piece of information. This atomicity makes notes versatile and reusable across different contexts. ### 2. Unique Identifiers Each note has a unique identifier (traditionally a number or alphanumeric code) that allows for precise referencing and linking. ### 3. Connections Between Notes The power of the Zettelkasten comes from the connections between notes. By linking related ideas, you create a network of knowledge that can reveal unexpected insights. ### 4. Non-hierarchical Organization Rather than organizing notes into rigid categories or folders, the Zettelkasten relies on links and tags to create a flexible, emergent structure. ## Benefits of the Zettelkasten Method - **Improves thinking**: By breaking down complex ideas into atomic notes and connecting them, you develop a deeper understanding of the material. - **Enhances creativity**: The network of connections can lead to unexpected insights and new ideas. - **Builds knowledge over time**: The system becomes more valuable as it grows, with new notes enriching existing ones. - **Reduces cognitive load**: By externalizing your thoughts, you free up mental resources for thinking rather than remembering. - **Supports writing and research**: The interconnected notes provide a rich source of material for articles, papers, and books. ## Digital Implementation While Luhmann used physical index cards, modern implementations of the Zettelkasten method are often digital. Digital tools offer advantages like: - Full-text search - Automatic backlinks - Multimedia support - Portability - Easy editing and reorganizing Popular digital tools for implementing a Zettelkasten include: - Obsidian - Roam Research - Notion - Zettlr - The Archive - And of course, digital gardens like this one! ## Getting Started with Zettelkasten 1. **Start small**: Begin with a few notes on topics you're interested in. 2. **Focus on connections**: As you add notes, look for ways to connect them to existing ones. 3. **Write for your future self**: Make your notes clear and self-contained so they'll make sense when you revisit them. 4. **Add context**: Include references to sources and your own thoughts. 5. **Review regularly**: Periodically review your notes to find new connections and refresh your memory. ## Related Notes - [[digital-garden-philosophy]] - [[networked-thought]] - [[how-to-use-wikilinks]] - [[why-zettelkasten-is-not-for-me]] - [Atomic Habits]({% link _books/atomic-habits.md %}) ## References 1.

      "content": "# Atomic Habits *Atomic Habits* is a book by James Clear that explores how small, incremental changes can lead to remarkable results over time. The book provides a practical framework for building good habits and breaking bad ones. ## Key Concepts ### 1. The Power of Tiny Changes Clear argues that improvements of just 1% each day can yield exponential results over time. The effects of our habits multiply as we repeat them. ### 2. The Four Laws of Behavior Change The book presents a framework for creating good habits and breaking bad ones: - **Make it obvious** (cue) - **Make it attractive** (craving) - **Make it easy** (response) - **Make it satisfying** (reward) ### 3. Identity-Based Habits One of the most powerful insights in the book is that lasting change comes from focusing on who you wish to become, not just what you want to achieve. When habits become part of your identity, they're much more likely to stick. ### 4. Habit Stacking Clear introduces the concept of \"habit stacking,\" which involves pairing a new habit with an existing one to make it easier to implement. ## Connections to Other Ideas The concept of small, incremental improvements in Atomic Habits connects well with the [[zettelkasten-method]], which emphasizes building knowledge gradually through small, interconnected notes. The focus on systems rather than goals aligns with the philosophy of [[digital-garden-philosophy]], where the emphasis is on the process of growing ideas rather than producing finished products. ## References 1.

      "content": "# How to Take Smart Notes *How to Take Smart Notes* by Sönke Ahrens is a comprehensive guide to the Zettelkasten method of note-taking developed by German sociologist Niklas Luhmann. The book explains how to implement this system to improve thinking, learning, and writing. ## Key Ideas ### The Slip-box (Zettelkasten) System Ahrens details Luhmann's slip-box system, which involves: 1. **Taking fleeting notes** - Quick, temporary notes to capture ideas 2. **Taking literature notes** - Notes about what you read 3. **Taking permanent notes** - Well-formulated notes that capture ideas in a way that will make sense even when you've forgotten the context 4. **Adding permanent notes to the slip-box** - Filing these notes in a system where they can connect to other ideas 5. **Developing topics and questions** - Using the network of notes to develop lines of thought 6. **Turning notes into writing projects** - Converting the material into finished pieces of writing ### Writing as a Thinking Tool Ahrens emphasizes that writing is not just about communicating ideas but about developing them. The act of writing forces us to clarify our thinking and make connections between ideas. ### Bottom-up vs. Top-down Approaches Rather than starting with a thesis and looking for evidence (top-down), Ahrens advocates for a bottom-up approach: collect ideas, look for connections, and let insights emerge organically. ## Practical Takeaways 1. **Write everything down** - Don't rely on your memory; externalize your thoughts. 2. **Keep notes atomic** - Each note should contain one idea, making it easier to connect with other ideas. 3. **Connect notes liberally** - The value of the system comes from the connections between notes. 4. **Write for your future self** - Notes should be self-contained and understandable even when you've forgotten the context. 5. **Review regularly** - Periodically review your notes to find connections and refresh your memory. 6. **Let structure emerge** - Don't impose a rigid structure; let it emerge from the connections between notes. ## Impact on My Note-taking This book completely transformed how I approach note-taking and knowledge management. I've implemented a digital version of the Zettelkasten system, which has helped me: - Retain more of what I read - Make unexpected connections between ideas - Develop more original insights - Write more easily and fluently - Build a valuable knowledge asset over time ## Favorite Quotes > \"Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying, it is the medium of all this work.\" > \"The slip-box is designed to present you with ideas you have already forgotten, allowing your brain to focus on thinking instead of remembering.\" > \"We can only think about what is already present in our internal memory. Everything else is invisible to us.\" > \"The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made a decision on your topic.\" ## Related Notes - [[zettelkasten-method]] - [[networked-thought]] - [[digital-garden-philosophy]] - [[how-to-use-wikilinks]] ## Further Reading If you enjoyed this book, you might also like: - *Building a Second Brain* by Tiago Forte - *Digital Minimalism* by Cal Newport - *How to Read a Book* by Mortimer Adler",

      "content": "# The Well of Ascension *The Well of Ascension* is the second book in Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn trilogy, continuing the story after the fall of the Final Empire. The book explores the challenges of building something new after destroying the old, as Vin and Elend struggle to establish a new government while facing external threats and internal political turmoil. ## Key Concepts ### 1. The Challenge of Creation vs. Destruction While the first book focused on overthrowing an evil empire, this sequel explores the much more difficult task of building something better in its place. Sanderson shows that destruction is often easier than creation. ### 2. Political Intrigue and Leadership The book delves deep into the complexities of governance, showing how idealistic leaders like Elend must navigate the messy reality of politics, compromise, and the competing interests of various factions. ### 3. The Nature of Power Vin's growing power as a Mistborn raises questions about the responsibility that comes with great ability and how power can corrupt even those with good intentions. ## Plot Development ### The Siege of Luthadel The city faces multiple threats: - **Koloss armies** - Savage, transformed humans who serve the Lord Ruler - **Political factions** - Various groups vying for control of the new government - **The Well of Ascension** - A mysterious power source that may hold the key to survival ### Character Arcs #### Vin Vin's journey continues as she struggles with: - Her growing power and its effects on her relationships - The weight of responsibility as the city's protector - Her relationship with Elend and how it changes with their new roles #### Elend Elend's transformation from idealistic scholar to practical leader shows the challenges of maintaining principles while making difficult decisions. ## Worldbuilding Expansion ### New Allomantic Powers The book introduces: - **Duralumin** - Enhances other metals when burned together - **Aluminum** - Clears all metal reserves - **The Eleventh Metal** - A mysterious new metal with unknown properties ### The Koloss These transformed humans represent the consequences of the Lord Ruler's experiments and serve as both a threat and a symbol of the empire's dark legacy. ## Themes and Philosophy ### The Hero's Burden The book explores what happens after the hero's journey ends - the ongoing responsibility and the realization that saving the world is just the beginning. ### The Cost of Change Sanderson shows that revolution has consequences, and the aftermath can be as challenging as the initial struggle. ### Love and Duty The relationship between Vin and Elend is tested by their new responsibilities, exploring how love must adapt to changing circumstances. ## Writing Craft ### Pacing and Structure The book maintains tension through: - Multiple converging plotlines - Political maneuvering that affects the military situation - Personal conflicts that mirror larger societal struggles ### Character Development Sanderson excels at showing character growth through action and difficult choices rather than exposition. ## Connections to Other Ideas The theme of building new systems after old ones fail connects to [[systems-should-flex-to-life]], showing how rigid structures must be replaced with more adaptable ones. The challenge of maintaining ideals while making practical decisions relates to [[principles-and-beliefs]] and how we balance our values with real-world constraints. ## Favorite Quotes > \"I write these words in steel, for anything not set in metal cannot be trusted.\" > \"The best liars are those who tell the truth most of the time.\" > \"Sometimes, you have to destroy something to save it.\" ## Related Notes - [[networked-thought]] - How complex systems interact and change - [[digital-garden-philosophy]] - The ongoing process of building and maintaining knowledge ## Further Reading Continue the series with: - *The Hero of Ages* (Mistborn Book 3) - *The Alloy of Law* (Wax and Wayne Book 1) ## Series Context This middle book in the trilogy serves as both a continuation and a bridge, showing the consequences of the first book's events while setting up the final confrontation. It's often considered the most complex of the three books due to its focus on politics and the challenges of governance.",

      "title": "Tiny Experiments",
      "content": "# Tiny Experiments *Tiny Experiments* by Anne-Laure Le Cunff advocates for embracing curiosity and experimentation over traditional goal-setting. The book argues that we pursue the \"ladder\" of success and burn ourselves out with endless goals that relentlessly push the target further, while failing to allow for exploration, failure, and curiosity. Instead of rigid purposes and SMART goals, Le Cunff proposes the PACT framework—creating purposeful, actionable, continuous, and trackable experiments that focus on outputs rather than outcomes. The book emphasizes working with natural rhythms, practicing mindful productivity, reframing procrastination as exploration, and learning in public through community engagement. ## Introduction There are times when we must let ourselves slow down so we can gain better focus on what really matters. American psychiatrist **Irvin Yalom** proposes awakening experiences that shake us free of our routines and defenses. Le Cunff also references **Joseph Campbell's** \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces.\" At heart, we are adventurers who grow up exploring and asking questions. As we mature, we quit questioning and exploring, trying instead to be the one with the answers. Traditional goals support the pursuit of control and minimizing failure, preventing creativity, exploration, and new opportunities. ## Part I: Commit to Curiosity ### Chapter 1: Why Goal Setting is Broken At heart, we are adventurers who grow up exploring and asking questions. As we grow up, we quit questioning and exploring and try to be the one with the answers. Because traditional goals support the pursuit of control and minimizing failure, they prevent creativity, exploration, and new opportunities. SMART goals look to create an achievable timeline in a linear fashion for goals. However, most people get paralyzed by determining the next action to take. The traditional goal system breeds a competitive and unhappy culture where the \"ideal\" you is always in the future. In the face of uncertainty, we often adopt one of three mindsets: - Escapism - Cynicism - Perfectionism ### Chapter 2: Escaping the Tyranny of Purpose A focus on a \"purpose\" is a reductionist mindset where we limit our potential. Instead of a singular purpose, we can pursue and be lots of things. **Cognitive scripts** give us a planned expectation or reaction based on how things go. These give us confidence and avoid a feeling of uncertainty. We are influenced by society to find a single thing we are good at and only pursue that one thing. When in reality, we can be and pursue many interests or curiosities that can open even more opportunities for us. Capture your life through the eyes of a researcher to discover what interests you currently have. Make capture easy and low friction to make it more likely. What to capture: - Insights - Energy - Mood - Encounters ### Chapter 3: A Pact to Turn Doubts into Experiments When designing a personal experiment, focus on your outputs rather than your outcomes. **PACT:** - Purposeful - Actionable - Continuous - Trackable (did you do? yes or no?) \"I will learn to code\" - Flawed \"I will code every day for a hundred days\" - Great Commit to a realistic number of repetitions of the experiment. Longer will mean more data but harder to maintain. Shorter will be easier to maintain with less data. A Pact is not a habit. Habits are not time-bound and aim to get a specific result. We love the idea of effort but would rather not put it in. Pacts are repetition-bound experiments that focus on outputs rather than outcomes. They are meant to build enough experience in our experimental area to determine if we want to continue. Pacts are not habits, but can be used to determine if we want to start a habit. Often when planning a project, we try to go for the more ambitious thinking that it will reward greater. When coming up with a Pact, think about the smallest version you can run. It will be easier to maintain, even on the worst days. ## Part II: Practice Mindful Productivity ### Chapter 4: A Deep Sense of Time We relentlessly pursue productivity out of fear of the limited time we have available to us. Physical representations of time scare us because it makes time seem so limited. However, our perception of time is much less contained. \"Not all moments are created equal\" Our personal experiments do not need to be large. It can be tempting to go for the more ambitious experiments. However, it becomes more difficult to maintain the experiment. Also, time and productivity do not need to be maximized in order to have meaning. Our perception of time allows small or long moments to stretch or shrink. So the goal is not to get as much done as possible in a small amount of time, but to get meaningful things done in a mindful way. Natural rhythms play a part in our energy throughout the day. I might look into the energy tracking apps again. Sequential focus is different than time boxing. With sequential focus, we assess our current state of mind and energy and ask what is the most sensible task to handle right now. **Kairos rituals** are tiny rituals that cue our bodies and minds into mindful productivity. Each person can have their own. Wonder what mine should be? Natural rhythms play an important role in our abilities to be productive. We need to become aware of our energy. We then need to lean into that energy when working to accomplish our more energy-necessary tasks when we are at a peak. Don't be afraid to take breaks to get into better headspace. ## Managing Your Experiments Procrastination is not always bad. Sometimes we need to reframe. Don't punish, explore instead: - Are we excited by the task/project? - Is the task/project the wisest approach? - Are we capable of completing it? - Embrace imperfection - Awareness of your perfection tendencies - Allow imperfect to focus on specifics - We cannot do everything **Iterate:** - Make small adjustments - Reflection is key to avoid repeats - Plus: what's in your next system - Positives that happened - Negatives that happened - Future-facing changes or next actions **Experiment complete. What now?** **Persist:** - The experiment is going well and you want to continue **Pause:** - The experiment did not go well or circumstances have changed - Pause, either indefinitely or temporarily **Pivot:** - Adjust but loop to next step **Managing obstacles:** - Accept the obstacle - Recognize internal feelings - Adjust: How to move forward? **Community Flow:** When we work with others we can find flow. Communities offer access to more knowledge: - Communities can be online - Explore online communities - Learning in public: - Unpolished, maybe even incorrect - Iterate and grow - Accept feedback, hive mind thinking - Give back, answer others learning publicly - Generative loops of iterative: - Grow, learn, fail, repeat - Sometimes our successes come from unexpected places - Use your knowledge to help others ## Key Takeaways 1. **Embrace curiosity over rigid goals** - Allow yourself to explore multiple interests rather than forcing yourself into a single purpose 2. **Use the PACT framework** for designing personal experiments that focus on outputs, not outcomes 3. **Work with your natural rhythms** - Pay attention to your energy levels and schedule important work accordingly 4. **Start small** - The smallest version of an experiment is easier to maintain and provides valuable learning 5. **Make capture easy** - Track insights, energy, mood, and encounters to understand what truly interests you 6. **Practice sequential focus** - Choose tasks based on your current state of mind and energy, not arbitrary time blocks 7. **Reframe procrastination** - Sometimes procrastination signals a need to explore rather than punish yourself 8. **Iterate through reflection** - Use reflection to identify what worked, what didn't, and what to change 9. **Learn in public** - Share your unpolished work, accept feedback, and grow through community interaction 10. **Persist, Pause, or Pivot** - After an experiment, consciously choose whether to continue, pause, or adjust your approach ## References 1.
