# Timing of Cold Plunges

## After Strength Training

### For Hypertrophy

- It is generally recommended to avoid cold plunges immediately after strength training if your goal is hypertrophy (muscle growth).
- Cold exposure can blunt the inflammatory response that is necessary for muscle growth.
- If you want to use cold plunges for recovery, consider waiting at least 24 hours.

## After Cardio

### For Recovery and Muscle Soreness Reduction

- If you aim to decrease muscle soreness and inflammation, taking a cold plunge soon after cardio can be beneficial.
- Cold exposure can help reduce muscle soreness and speed up recovery.
- Typically within 30 minutes after cardio is ideal for maximum benefits.

### Performance Adaptation

- If your goal is to improve performance, avoid cold plunges immediately after cardio.
- Cold exposure can interfere with the adaptations your body makes from endurance training.
- Consider waiting at least 24 hours before taking a cold plunge after cardio sessions.

### General Well-Being

- If your goal is general well-being and stress relief, you can take a cold plunge at any time that feels good for you.
