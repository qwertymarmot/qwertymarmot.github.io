# Timing of Cold Plunges

## For Hypertrophy

- It is generally recommended to avoid cold plunges immediately after strength training if your goal is hypertrophy (muscle growth).
- Cold exposure can blunt the inflammatory response that is necessary for muscle growth.
- If you want to use cold plunges for recovery, consider waiting at least 24 hours.
