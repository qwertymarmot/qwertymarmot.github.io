# My findings from a week long experiment

- It's hard to find methods beyond subjective that allow me to determine if cold plunges help prevent or decrease the amount of fatigue i feel from workouts.
- Subjectively, I felt like my experiment and ongoing I have been able to recover much more quickly from strenuous exercise.
