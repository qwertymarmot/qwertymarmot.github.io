# Welcome to My Digital Garden

This is my digital garden, a place where I cultivate ideas, thoughts, and knowledge. Unlike traditional blogs, a digital garden is a non-linear collection of interconnected notes that grow and evolve over time.

## What is a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is a different approach to content creation and knowledge management. Instead of publishing polished, finished articles, a digital garden embraces the idea of "learning in public" and shows the evolution of thoughts and ideas.

Some key characteristics of digital gardens:

- **Non-linear**: Notes are connected through links rather than chronology
- **Evolving**: Content is constantly updated and refined
- **Interconnected**: Ideas link to each other, forming a network of knowledge
- **Personal**: It reflects the gardener's interests and thinking process

## How to Navigate This Garden

You can explore this garden in several ways:

1. Browse the notes on the homepage
2. Use the search function to find specific topics
3. Click on tags to see related notes
4. Follow wikilinks to discover connected ideas
5. Explore the graph visualization to see the network of notes

## Types of Notes

In this garden, notes are categorized by their stage of development:
- **Evergreen notes**: Well-developed, mature ideas
- **Seedling notes**: Early thoughts that need development
- **Budding notes**: Ideas that are starting to take shape
