# Digital Garden Philosophy

The digital garden philosophy represents a shift in how we think about creating and sharing content online. It's a move away from the chronological, stream-based approach of traditional blogs toward something more organic and interconnected.

## Core Principles

### 1. Tending vs. Publishing

Digital gardens are meant to be tended to over time, not just published once and forgotten. Like a real garden, they require regular care, pruning, and attention. Notes evolve as your understanding deepens.

### 2. Learning in Public

Digital gardens embrace the concept of "learning in public" â€” sharing your thoughts and ideas even when they're not fully formed. This approach values the process of learning as much as the end result.

### 3. Non-linear Organization

Unlike blogs, which are organized chronologically, digital gardens are organized by context and connection. Ideas link to other ideas, creating a web of knowledge that can be explored in multiple ways.

### 4. Epistemic Humility

Digital gardens acknowledge that knowledge is always evolving and incomplete. They embrace uncertainty and revision, rather than presenting ideas as definitive or final.

## Historical Context

The term "digital garden" has roots in the early web, but gained popularity in the late 2010s as a response to the limitations of social media and traditional blogging. It draws inspiration from:

- **Hypertext**: The original vision of the web as an interconnected knowledge space
- **Wikis**: Collaborative, interlinked knowledge bases
- **Zettelkasten**: A note-taking method focused on connections between ideas
- **Personal knowledge management**: Tools and systems for organizing personal knowledge

## Digital Gardens vs. Traditional Blogs
