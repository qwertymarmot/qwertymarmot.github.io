# How to Use Wikilinks

Wikilinks are a powerful feature of digital gardens that allow you to create connections between notes. They're a simple way to link to other notes in your garden, making it easy to navigate and discover related ideas.

## What Are Wikilinks?

Wikilinks (also called bidirectional links) are a special type of link that uses double square brackets to reference another note. For example, `note-title` creates a link to a note with the title "note-title".

What makes wikilinks special is that they create a two-way connection:
1. The link in your current note points to the target note
2. The target note automatically shows a "backlink" pointing back to your current note

This bidirectional nature helps build a network of interconnected ideas.

## How to Create Wikilinks

Creating wikilinks in your digital garden is simple:

1. Identify a concept or idea that should link to another note
2. Surround the concept with double square brackets: `like this`
3. The text inside the brackets will be used to find or create the target note

### Examples

```markdown
This is a link to [[welcome-to-my-digital-garden]].

I'm learning about the [[zettelkasten-method]] for note-taking.

Check out this book: [[Book: How to Take Smart Notes]].
```

## Best Practices for Wikilinks

To get the most out of wikilinks in your digital garden:

### 1. Link Liberally

Don't be shy about creating links. The more connections you make, the richer your garden becomes. If you mention a concept that has its own note (or should have its own note), link to it.

### 2. Use Consistent Naming

Try to be consistent in how you name your notes and how you reference them. This makes it easier to create and maintain links.

### 3. Create Links Before Notes

You can create wikilinks to notes that don't exist yet. This is a great way to identify gaps in your garden that you might want to fill later.

### 4. Review Backlinks

Regularly review the backlinks section of your notes to discover unexpected connections and to see how ideas relate to each other.

### 5. Link to Books

To link to a book note, use the format `[[Book: How to Take Smart Notes]]`. This helps distinguish book notes from regular notes.

## Wikilinks vs. Traditional Links

| Wikilinks | Traditional HTML Links |
|-----------|------------------------|
| `note-title` | `[Link text](url)` |
| Bidirectional | One-way only |
| Internal to your garden | Can link anywhere |
| Focus on connections | Focus on navigation |
| Automatically show backlinks | No backlink tracking |
