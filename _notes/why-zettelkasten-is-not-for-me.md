# The Why

- I am not intrigued by the idea of adding titles and tags to every note
- The physical nature of a zettelkasten just does not inspire me
- I much prefer the idea and structure of a digital garden
- I think the zettelkasten would apply more if I was an academic researcher but I am not that at all
