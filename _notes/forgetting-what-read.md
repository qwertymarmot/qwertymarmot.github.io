## Tips to solve this issue
- Translate instead of summarize. When you translate you make the ideas unique to your perspectives, which helps them stick.
- Don't force it. Sometimes ideas that seem important won't stick. That is not an issue, it is feedback that the ideas don't work for us.
- Make connections between material. in isolation the ideas will fizzle out.
- Take time after finishing reading. Take a few days and come back to your notes. Ask yourself what stuck and what didnt. Lean into the things that made an impact.
