This is a placeholder file for book cover images.

In a real implementation, you would place actual image files (JPG, PNG) in this directory.

For example:
- how-to-take-smart-notes.jpg
- building-a-second-brain.jpg
- etc.

The book cover images should ideally be:
- 300px wide by 450px tall
- In JPG or PNG format
- Less than 100KB in size for optimal performance
